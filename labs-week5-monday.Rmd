```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

We will use the `ames` data set from the `modeldata` library. It can be loaded using the following code

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tidymodels)
data("ames")
```

We will try to predict the `Sale_Price` of a house by the `Longitude` of its location (this would not be the best idea alone, but serves as an example). Use `step_bs()` to fit a spline onto `Longitude` use cross-validation to find the value of `degree` where the model performs best.

Next we will use `step_discretize()` and `step_cut()` to fit step function nto `Longitude` to see if that works better.
