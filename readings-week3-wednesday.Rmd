Please read chapter 5 in "An Introduction to Statistical Learning", which looks at bootstrapping and cross-validation. In addition will we also talk about data leakage some more.
We will also be talking about evaluating model performance so please also read chapter [9 - Judging model effectiveness](https://www.tmwr.org/performance.html) in "Tidy Modeling with R, which we will use as the introduction for the R package [yardstick](https://yardstick.tidymodels.org/).

The accompanied tidymodels labs can be found [here](https://emilhvitfeldt.github.io/ISLR-tidymodels-labs/resampling-methods.html).
